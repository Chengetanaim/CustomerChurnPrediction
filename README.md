# Customer churn prediction

Customer churn prediction is predicting the likelihood of customer to keep subscribing to a certain business or not.  
In this project I used data preprocessing techniques to clean data and transform it into a usable format for our model.
I then used artificial neural networks to train the model using 500 epochs and the model got an accuracy report of around 86%.

## What I learnt:

- learning how an artificial neural network trains
- using different arguments when creating a neural network for better accuracy
- using the confusion matrix to get the accuracy report
